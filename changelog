November 6, 2015 - Time Goes By So Slowly Edition
----------------------------
- Fixed calculator restoring timer/EXP regions from saved data if JP was selected
- ...so, uh, how's your day? Are you ready to play one week of Nozomi Token Event without EX rotation?
- Remember the temporary fix I made in "September 3 - #FuckKLabHard edition"? Still here, because what even is a event schedule. Thanks KLab EN

October 21, 2015 - Steampunk Eli, Holy Shit Edition
----------------------------
- Fixed MedFes calculator not correctly reading EXP multiplier
- Fixed SM and MedFes pages not correctly restoring EXP multiplier from saved data
- Also, update on the previous prononciation thing: it seems KLab were going for the "club" (kurabbu) pun. That's how it's correctly pronounced.
- No idea how this should work in EN though. Maybe just stay at clap? Go for crap? #burn

October 5, 2015 - This Will Never End Edition
----------------------------
- Two months later, and EXP limits are still not halved on EN server. #FuckKLabEN
- Added EXP requirements choice below EXP input, because KLab EN will probably not reduce them in the next century
- Fixed bug on iOS devices where saving configuration would not save region correctly
- By the way, did you know KLab is pronounced more like "clap" instead of "kaylab"? what even is this

September/October, 2015 - What Even Is An Event Schedule Edition
----------------------------
- Didn't make seperate entries for every time a new event started with shit-tier dates and moving the double EXP

September 7, 2015 - The Day KLab Was A Fucking Shit (Again) Edition
----------------------------
- what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what
- ".@suzuyasrei holy shit is KLab fucking serious right now should be fixed now but holy fucking shit KLab I'm only at the teacher #FuckKLab"
- WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT
- #FuckKLab

September 3, 2015 - #FuckKLabHard edition
----------------------------
- WHAT EVEN IS THIS? 8 DAY EVENT? This broke literally everything this code does for Automatic Calculation. Very temporary fix. Urgh.
- Moved 2x Rank Ups from Token to Score because still not halved. Fuck KLab America
- Don't fuck KLab Japan though because DID YOU SEE THAT LLSIF BOOTH?? Pls I want to play it someone give me money

August 18, 2015 - DARLING! HYPE edition
----------------------------
- Set EN end date override to the correct day
- KLab still didn't halve EXP requirements. Moved 2x Rank Ups to Token Event instead of Score Match. #FuckKLab

August 5, 2015 - #FuckKLab edition
----------------------------
- Double Rank Up requirements are back for Score Match, because KLab didn't cut down the EXP limits! Yaaay. As before, double Rank Up requirements are only in effect on the Score Match page, not the others... let's hope KLab does this after the current event, or else I'll just add a more permanent solution (as in, more radio buttons)
- You can now select your region on Automatic Calculation, so the time limit is more accurate
- Saved configuration data now expires 48 hours after the end of the event (so data is blank for the next one!)

~ PART 2 an hour later
- Fixed being able to select both Timer methods on Medley Festival
- EN timer region is (visibly) selected by default

July 31, 2015 - Give COUPONS edition
-----------------------------------------
- Undid double Rank Up requirements
- Fixed a bug on Score Match and Medley Festival where 1234 + 100 resulted in 1234100 (thanks weak typing!)

July 28, 2015 - Experience edition
----------------------------
- Added EXP input for more exact calculations when close to level up
- Doubled all Rank Up requirements below Rank 100 for Token Event. JP has been halving all EXP limits below Rank 100 since the Couupon/Voucher update, and that's what this calculator has been using ever since, even though the EN translated calculator has probably been used for more EN than JP events. I fixed that, however, since this Kotori Token Event is the last one for us before we get the Coupon Update too, I didn't create a switch or something, but just hardcoded it into the page. Will be undone after the event is over, since we'll all have the same requirements then

July 27, 2015 - Rehosting edition
---------------------------
- wget'd the page from yefta while ignoring certificates and put it on my site. Rehosting made easy
- Removed Google Analytics from the site
